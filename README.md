# Test playground

## Playing with tests using jest

In an effort to grasp the idea behind tests, and TDD I've taken to various examples and played around with tests a bunch, first by simply throwing errors around during if statements if a condition weren't met. And then refactoring the code to leverage the power of jest.

Doing this, hopefully I can start bringing a test driven approach to my future work.

To finish I am going to embrace the TDD approach to working. Making tests before the "actual code"
